## **1. How to prepare for GATE CSE exam?**

To prepare effectively, follow these steps:

### **a) Complete Syllabus**

* First, cover the **entire syllabus**. Don’t leave any subject.
* Even if some subjects seem “easy” or “less important,” questions can come from anywhere.
* GATE is very competitive, so you **cannot afford to ignore any topic**.

### **b) Notes**

* **Main Notes:** Optional. I personally didn’t make main notes.
* **Short Notes:** **Essential.** Make short notes for all subjects. I made mine and you can access them [here] (attach link).
* These help in **quick revision** before exams.

### **c) Revision**

* **Revise each topic at least 15 times**, especially because of the trend of **Multiple Select Questions (MSQs)**.
* Revision helps retain concepts and avoid silly mistakes in tricky questions.

### **d) Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**

* Solve **all PYQs at least 3 times**:

  * Topic-wise
  * Year-wise
  * As full-length tests
* Mark important questions or concepts for **last-minute revision**.
* Recommended source: **GATE Overflow PDF**

  * Many coaching PYQ books are not useful — save time and focus on **Gate Overflow**.
  * You’ll get **multiple solutions and explanations**, which helps your **concept clarity** a lot.

### **e) Test Series**

* Recommended: **GO Classes** — 27 full mocks, enough for preparation.
* If you have time, you can also use **Gate Overflow Test Series**.
* Avoid buying multiple test series — most are a waste of money.

### **f) Mistake Log**

* Extremely important! Maintain a **mistake log** for every mock/test:

  * Note **why a question was wrong**: silly mistake, conceptual mistake, calculation error, skipped, or hurried.
  * Revise this **before the next mock**.
  * Do this **topic-wise, subject-wise, and for full-length tests**.
* This ensures you **don’t repeat mistakes** and gradually improve.

## **2. What is a good target score for GATE?**

* Don’t stress about marks, scores, or rank.
* Focus on **improvement** — every day, try to **reduce mistakes and understand concepts better**.
* Score and rank are **just byproducts** of consistent and proper preparation.

---

## **3. What rank/marks are needed for IITs or PSUs?**

* Generally, a **top 100 rank** is considered very good.
* But don’t obsess over numbers — follow the **“excellence first, success will follow”** approach.
* Focus on **learning deeply and improving daily**, and rank will automatically come.

---

## **4. Should I focus on all topics or selective subjects?**

* **Focus on the entire syllabus.**
* Many times, a **hard question can come from your favorite subject**, and the **easy ones from subjects you dislike**.
* Past trends show that leaving some subjects is **very risky** because the competition is high.
* Complete coverage ensures you can **attempt every question confidently**, which is necessary for a **high rank**.

Perfect! Here's the revised and **polished answer** including your new points:

## **5. How many resources are required to get a good rank? Are more books or coaching materials needed?**

**Answer:**
You **don’t need to follow multiple books or materials** to get a good rank. Focus on these two things:

### **a) Previous Year Questions (PYQs)**

* Solve **all PYQs at least 3 times** — topic-wise, year-wise, and as full-length tests.
* PYQs are **the most valuable resource**, as they show the exact pattern and type of questions.
* **There are ~4000+ PYQs**, covering almost every topic you need for GATE CSE.

### **b) Test Series**

* Take **mock tests regularly** to practice variations of questions.
* Recommended: **GO Classes test series** (27 full mocks, ~6000+ questions including topic-wise, subject-wise tests, full mocks).
* If you have time, you can also use **Gate Overflow test series**, but it’s optional.
* Avoid buying multiple test series or random books — most are not necessary.

### **Key Point:**

* Between PYQs (~4000+) and test series (~6000+), you already have **10,000+ questions**.
* **This is enough to get an AIR under 50**, if you practice and revise properly.
* To get **AIR under 25, 10, or AIR 1**, it’s **not more knowledge**, it’s **execution** — how well you solve, revise, and eliminate mistakes.

**Important:**

* Don’t waste time on extra coaching material or random practice books.
* Proper PYQ practice + a good test series + consistent **mistake log** = enough to secure a high rank.
